\section{Overview}

PDF Translator is a Python-based tool for translating PDF documents using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and deep learning techniques. It utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision models and machine translation algorithms to extract text from PDF documents, translate it into a target language, and generate a new PDF with the translated text in the same format as the original document.

\section{Functionality}

The PDF Translator project includes the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
\item PDF-to-image conversion: The tool converts a PDF file into a list of preprocessed images for OCR processing.
\item OCR text extraction: The tool extracts text from each image using the CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection) and CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) models.
\item Machine translation: The tool translates the extracted texts using the OpenNMT (Open Neural Machine Translation) model.
\item PDF generation: The tool generates a new PDF with the translated text in the same layout as the original document.
\item Configuration file: The tool can read configuration settings from a JSON or YAML file to make it easier to modify the settings without having to modify the code.
\item Command-line interface: The tool can be run from the command-line with various arguments to specify input and output files, models, and other settings.
\item Package distribution: The tool can be distributed as a Python package with all its dependencies and entry points specified in a setup.py file.
\end{itemize}

\section{Usage}

The PDF Translator tool can be used in various environments, including local machines, Google Colab, Jupyter notebooks, and Binder. Here are the steps to use the tool:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Install the required packages: pdf2image, Pillow, opencv-python, opennmt-py, numpy, pytesseract, and pdfminer.six.
\item Download the pre-trained models for CRAFT, CRNN, and OpenNMT and save them in a directory.
\item Create a configuration file (JSON or YAML) with the input and default values for the program.
\item Run the tool with the appropriate arguments to specify the input PDF, output PDF, models, and other settings.
\end{enumerate}

Here's an example of how to run the tool from the command line:

\begin{verbatim}
python main.py --input input.pdf --output output.pdf
--model model.pt --craft-model craft_model.pt
--crnn-model crnn_model.pt --dpi 300
--target-language fr --beam-width 5 --length-penalty 1.0
\end{verbatim}

This command translates the input PDF file \texttt{input.pdf} into French using the pre-trained models \texttt{model.pt}, \texttt{craft_model.pt}, and \texttt{crnn_model.pt}, with a DPI of 300, a beam width of 5, and a length penalty of 1.0. The translated PDF is saved as \texttt{output.pdf} in the same layout as the original document.

\section{Distribution}

The PDF Translator tool can be distributed as a Python package using the \texttt{setuptools} package. To create a distribution package, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

\begin{verbatim}
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
